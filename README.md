# Domelx

This is the control software for Hacks r us' LED dome. It's based on the excellent [Lxstudio][2] by heronarts

## Getting started
- Install [Processing][1]
- Clone the project
- Run domelx.pde

## Patterns
There is a demo pattern included with lxstudio in Patterns.pde. Please contribute more cool stuff and we'll run it on the dome!

## Developing
You can just use processing's built-in editor, but if you want to use your own editor/IDE:

- Open processing
- Tools>Install Processing-java

This will install the `processing-java` command line tool, allowing you to run Processing sketches from a terminal/your favourite editor's build system instead of the processing GUI. I use sublime text and [processing-sublime][3]
